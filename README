This is Trieste, a Distributed File System. Here are some bare instrunction on
how to compile:

* decompress (I think you already did that).
* edit fuse/conf. modify the --prefix and --with-kernel options to your needs.
$ make config (this runs a configure script under the fuse dir).
$ make
# make install (run as root. installs the kernel and sets some permissions)

If you're running some debians and ubuintus (I think they' re sid and breezy),
that last command might fail miserably. try:

* make CC=gcc-3.3

or any other gcc you might have installed (gcc-3.4 and gcc-4.0 seem to be the
problematic ones).

Unluckily, it runs only against linux-kernel-2.4. I' ll try to fix that ASAP. To
run this beast:

* edit config.sh
$ ./run.sh <n>

where n is the amount of storage namagers you want.

$ PYTHONPATH=. ./utils/mkfs.py

formats the root dir. now it's ready for mounting.

$ ./fuse/util/fusermount -c <mntpt> ./virtue.py -b <netaddr>

where <mntpt> is the mount point and <netaddr> is the network address; or

$ ./fuse/util/fusermount -c <mntpt> ./virtue.py -c umbie://localhost:5647/

Now you can enter into <mntpt> and do whatever you do with a filesystem!

Some things are not tested yet, but the `b' part does not refers to `beta´. This
is sill **alpha**.

Any questions, send mails to Marcos Dione <mdione@grulic.org.ar> at will.
