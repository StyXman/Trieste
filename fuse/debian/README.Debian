fuse for Debian
---------------

To be able to use fuse, you need to install the appropriate fuse-module
package for your kernel version. For a self-compiled kernel, install
fuse-source, unpack the tarball /usr/src/fuse.tar, and run
make-kpkg modules from your kernel source tree. You should end up having
a fuse-module package in /usr/src/modules which you need to install with
dpkg -i fuse-module-...deb.
